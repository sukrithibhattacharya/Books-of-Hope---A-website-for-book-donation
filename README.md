# Books-of-Hope---A-website-for-book-donation
Books of Hope is a web-based platform that revolutionizes the process of donating books by making a better connection between people who donate and those in need. This project works on the usual issue of the unused books being wasted while many underprivileged people have trouble getting educational materials. In this platform the donors can list books they wish to donate. The system has a simple registration process for NGOs, educational institutes, the donors. They can create profiles and set particular book collection goals for the campaign. Students who have financial difficulties can also register to request for books directly on this platform, too. With the aim of removing old obstacles in book giving and sharing, Books of Hope digitizes and organizes this process. This project does more than just promote the ongoing use of educational resources; it also stands for literacy and education in communities that lack services. The solution changes an ordinary, unsystematic donation procedure to a well-structured system which brings benefits not only to those who give books but also those who receive them.
